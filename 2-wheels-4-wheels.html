        <p>In the last few years, I’ve seen major shift toward 4-wheel suitcases, everywhere. Well, almost everywhere.</p>
        <p>I’ve never seen a flight attendant with a spinner suitcase. In fact, it was challenging to find an image of a flight attendant with a spinner suitcase on the internet. <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?biw=1366&bih=638&tbm=isch&sa=1&q=flight+attendant+with+suitcase&oq=flight+attendant+with+suitcase&gs_l=psy-ab.3...2652.3053.0.3520.5.5.0.0.0.0.67.293.5.5.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..0.2.115...0i13k1.EVrX0iIaSYs" target="_blank">Here is a search in Google images.</a></p>
        <p>I think the reason for that is spinner suitcases are simply better for most people, but maybe not for frequent travellers and a few other exceptions. Read on as this is probably one of the biggest differences between suitcases, along with <a href="hard-or-soft-suitcase.html">the debate around soft versus hard shells.</a></p>
        
        <h2>4 wheels suitcases</h2>
        <p>Spinners have become extremely popular. And I can see why -- you must have seen how effortlessly people are spinning their 4-wheel suitcases around the airport. But there is  more:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Less effort.</strong> A lot less effort is required from you to move a spinner most of the time, unless it is a rough surface.</li>
            <li><strong>More balance.</strong> Spinners don’t fall over and can stand upright.</li>
            <li><strong>Ease of use.</strong> You can push a spinner in front of you, or by your side,or behind you. And it’s a lot easier to travel with more than one suitcase. I repeat, a lot easier.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All of this comes at a small cost, however:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Quality.</strong> Spinners tend to break a lot more easily, particularly the low quality ones, so if you are a frequent flyer you need to buy a higher end suitcase or you will soon regret it. So a good one is probably going to be more expensive than the 2-wheel alternative.</li>
            <li><strong>Space.</strong> For carry-ons, spinners offer less internal packing space and take up more room in the overhead compartment.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>2 wheels suitcases</h2>
        <p>As you have probably already figured out, 2 wheel suitcases are more sturdy and tend to break less. So they are better suited for frequent travellers or people that will use them on a rough surface. Check out the Travelpro FlightCrew range, most of which is on 2 wheels.</p>
        
        <p>The downside of 2 wheel suitcases is that in most situations they require more effort from you. And they can tip forward, but this typically isn’t a big issue.</p>

        
        <h2>What you should buy</h2>
        <p>Unless you’re a very frequent traveller (think flight attendant) or you’re planning to use your suitcase on a dirt road and/or the beautiful cobblestone roads of Rome, do yourself a favour and buy a spinner suitcase.</p>
        
        <h2>Bonus content</h2>
        <p>This is a how to luggage site, so it’s only appropriate to throw in a cheeky little tip from the pros.</p>
        <p>To instantly improve the durability of your suitcase (or to revive an old one from your closet), replace the wheels with inline skate wheels. Think about it for a moment -- these wheels are specifically designed to roll through streets, gracefully, and to take a beating.</p>
        <p>Here are some options on Amazon, just make sure you get the right size. Enjoy your new wheels!</p>
