									<h1>About TopTravelEssentials.com</h1>
									</header>

									<p>Hello and welcome to TopTravelEssentials. As you've probably already figured out, TopTravelEssentials is a collection of the best travel products - such as suitcases and bags - specifically for people who want to know what to buy quickly. Our promise to you is that every item that we present to you is high quality, offers great value for money, and has received excellent feedback from real customers.</p>
									<p>Think about the overwhelming amount of choice in a typical online store, even for everyday travel categories such as suitcases. Filtering items on price or ratings is helpful, but low quality products or items that rip you off can still pop up. We use the latest technology, such as summarisation algorithms, to process thousands of real customers reviews to narrow down the choices. We then spend tens of hours manually analysing every single item in order to present you with our final list of items. </p>
									<p>On top of all that, we use professional product reviews from the best editorial sources to cross-check our findings. Every single article that we produce outlines the differences between a good product and a great product. It also lists the stuff that you should watch our for when you select your items. The point is, we enable you to make an informed decision quickly and without much effort.</p>
									<p>At the end of the day, all products listed here are great and we would happily recommend them to our friends and family.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Why should you listen to us</h2>
									<p>When we buy items for ourselves (not just travel products) we spent countless hours researching the best options out there, carefully reading hundreds of customer reviews and going through multiple editorial reviews. What's the point of all that? We're obsessed with only buying top quality products, which offer great value for money. Low quality would be a compromise, whilst overpaying is simply not acceptable in today's information-rich world.</p>
									<p>We invest the same amount of time and energy in choosing our picks and recommendations in order to deliver our promise to you: a clear and concise list of the best products, outlining must-have features and things to watch our for when you buy your next travel product. </p>
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>How we select our picks</h2>
									<p>For each article, we start by applying basic filter criteria on the thousands of options on Amazon. We then create a databse with all customer reviews (often times 1,000+ of reviews) and use the latest algorithms for text summarisation and sentiment analysis in order to distinguish the good from the bad. This is the easy part. We are then left with about 100 products, which we manually analyse and narrow down the list, leaving us with the options presented to you.</p>
									<p>The reason this works is because using real reviews from paying customers is simply the best way to assess the worth of a product. Standard product descriptions from sellers and manufacturers can be biased and misleading. The best products are those which have a product description which perfectly matches customer reviews. On the flip side, claims in product reviews, such as "we use the best materials", are easily disproved with a few customer reviews showing that the bag didn't last very long. As the saying goes, the customer is always right.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Why links to Amazon instead of Buy buttons</h2>
									<p>These links support what we do. If our visitors choose to buy a product that we have recommended through these links, our work is supported by an affiliate commission from the retailer. In the event that you are unhappy with the product and return it for any reason, we don't get paid. It is a fair system, which benefits both you as a customer and the retailer, and rewards our efforts, all at the same time.</p>
									<p>

									Amazon is by far our most favourite way to do online shopping. It offers unparalled customer service, pricing, and choice. On top of all that, the convenience of Amazon Prime's next day delivery make it without a doubt the best way to do your online shopping. </p>
