        <p>Hello and welcome to my <strong>“How to luggage*”</strong> website.</p>

        <p>If my experience as a frequent traveller has taught me anything, it’s that when it comes to luggage, there is a trade-off between price and quality, especially durability. And of course style! :-)</p>

        <p>I used to buy suitcases which always broke after just a few uses - broken wheels and torn fabrics after a couple of flights or work trips. Yikes.</p>

        <p>That’s the reason why I started to research and very carefully choose my bags and suitcases. I now get the most for my dollars (almost every time!) and travel in style, without worrying that the wheels might come off!</p>

        <p>All of this led me to create this “how to luggage” website. I know it’s not grammatically correct, but it’s a pretty darn good description, isn’t it?</p>
        
        <div class="showcase">
            <h4 style="margin-left:30px">How to luggage<br><em>cool verb</em></h4>
            <p style="margin-left:50px"><strong>1. when buying a travel bag, get the most for your money and don’t regret your purchase</strong>
                <br><a style="color: grey">“Knowing how to luggage gives you the power to choose the best bag for your buck.”</a>
                <br><a style="color: grey"><strong>synonyms:</strong> being clever, intelligent, travel-savvy, values money</a>
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left:50px;padding-bottom: 30px;"><strong>2. travel in style and with confidence</strong>
            <br><a style="color: grey">“He obviously knows how to luggage, you can tell from a mile away!”</a>
                <br><a style="color: grey"><strong>synonyms:</strong> comfort, looking good, pretty fly for a white bag</a>
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <h2 id="how-pick">I know what I’m talking about</h2>
        <p>When I buy items for me (not just travel stuff) I spend a whole bunch of time researching the best options out there, sometimes carefully reading tens of customer reviews. It would be fair to call me a geek, no doubt.</p>
        <p>What's the point of all that, you’d ask. I am obsessed with value for money. I hate spending money on crappy stuff. </p>
        <p>And I don’t think it is acceptable to buy average stuff when so much information is available - customer reviews, videos, articles, you name it.</p>
        <p>The question is, have you got the spare time to do the research?</p>
        <p>Good news. I’ve done it for you. I’ve invested the same amount of time and energy in choosing the picks and recommendations on the website as I would do for my own stuff.</p>
        
        <h2>How I do it</h2>
        <p>For each article, I start by applying basic filter criteria on the thousands of options on Amazon. I then create a database (remember, I’m a geek) with all customer reviews (often times 1,000+ of reviews) and use some cool algorithms for text summarisation and sentiment analysis to distinguish the good from the bad.</p>
        <p>This is the easy part.</p>
        <p>I am then left with about 100 products, which I manually analyse to narrow down the list.</p>
        <p>The reason this works is because using real reviews from paying customers is simply the best way to assess the worth of a product. Standard product descriptions from sellers and manufacturers can be biased and misleading. The best products are those which have a product description, which perfectly matches customer reviews.</p>
        <p>On the flip side, claims in product reviews, such as "we use the best materials", are easily disproved with a few customer reviews showing that a bag didn't last very long.</p>
        
        <h2>Why links to Amazon?</h2>
        <p>These links support what I do and if you choose to buy a product that I have recommended, I get a small commission from Amazon. If you are unhappy with the product and return it for any reason, I don't get paid. Sad for me, but it’s a fair system.</p>
        <p>I also don’t do advertising on my website as I really hate spammy, completely unrelated, intrusive ads. You’re here to choose travel stuff like bags and suitcases, not play bingo or learn how to make £1,000 a day. So please use the link provided to help me keep up the good content.</p>
        <p>Amazon is by far my most favourite way to do online shopping. I don’t want to hear about other online retailers as I probably won’t use them. Amazon gives me unmatched customer service, pricing, and choice. On top of all that, the convenience of Amazon Prime's next day delivery makes it without a doubt the best way to do your online shopping. So don’t look any further.</p>
