										<h1>The Best Hand Luggage</h1>
									</header>

									<span class="image main"><img src="../images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>

									<p> <strong> We've reviewed the top 50 carry-on suitcases on Amazon with at least 4-star ratings and we've found that the American Tourister Bon Air 4 Wheel Suitcase offers the best balance of price, quality and durability. You can easily fit a week's worth of holiday clothes into the suitcase, which perfectly fits the hand luggage allowance.
									You will also be very pleased with the impressive interior and how easy it is to roll the suitcase in any direction with its 4 wheels. On top of all that, the combination lock provides extra security and peace of mind. </strong></p>

									<h2>What makes a great carry-on suitcase</h2>
									<p>The single most important thing is that your carry-on suitcase must fit your airline's hand luggage dimensions or you may need to check it in and pay extra. <strong> But what makes a great suitcase?</strong> To answer this question, we went through hundreds of products reviews and the analysis revealed that the following features separate a good suitcase from a great one:</p>
									<ul>
									<li>Lightweight is not merely a nice to have feature but an essential attribute due to airline hand luggage weight limitations.</li>
									<li>Numerical combination locks can provide extra security and peace of mind for your valuables.</li>
									<li>Suitcases with 4-wheels are easier to roll in any direction.</li>
									<li>If you are a frequent flyer, durability is the single most important feature to look for.</li>
									</ul>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Things to watch out for</h2>
									<p>The analysis also revealed the things to watch out for when selecting your hand luggage. Whilst none of these are deal-breakers, they are all things that can easily be avoided by carefully selecting your suitcase.</p>
									<ul>
									<li>Some very lightweight suitcases cannot stand upright, unless leaned against a wall.</li>
									<li>Lower quality suitcases are more likely to get cosmetic damage, or even get their fabric ripped.</li>
									<li>Spinner versions of suitcases (4-wheels) may have less internal space than two-wheeled equivalents.</li>
									<li>Hard-shell suitcases typically lack external pockets and have less packing space.</li>
									</ul>

									<h2>How we picked the bags</h2>
									<p>There are hundreds of hand luggage options on Amazon, even after filtering for the basic criteria that we use. We compiled a database of 1,000+ verified customer reviews of carry-on suitcases, which we then analysed to narrow down the list. The analysis revealed what features people personally find to be vital, as well as what attributes separate a great suitcase from an average one. It also allowed us to better understand the differences in wheel designs, fabric materials, interior designs, and handle models. Based on this, and coupled with our own extensive research of editorial reviews, we settled on our top picks.</p>
