        <p>There are many small differences between suitcases, but hard vs. soft is definitely not one of them. In fact, I think it’s probably one of the biggest differences, <a href="2-wheels-4-wheels.html">along with spinner vs. 2-wheels.</a></p>
        <p>Let's dive straight into the differences and my recommendation for you.</p>
        
        <h2>Soft suitcases</h2>
        <p>Most suitcases are soft and there is a reason for that -- softside suitcases will give you a lot more benefits than negatives.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>More flexible.</strong> By default, fabrics are very flexible. You can easily fit your weirdly-shaped objects in it or fit the suitcase in the tight space under your bed.</li>
            <li><strong>External pockets.</strong> These are great, and you will really value their functionality. Water bottles, boarding passes, your favourite book -- just some of the things that can go here.</li>
            <li><strong>You can open it while it’s standing.</strong> Yep, you don’t need a lot of effort and space to open your suitcase and quickly grab your jacket when the flight attendant announces that the local weather is -12 degrees.</li>
            <li><strong>Can be expandable..</strong> If you travel often, you know that packing needs can change (especially on your way back from a nice place). The flexibility from an expandable compartment is fantastic, and can be difference between using the same suitcase or buying a new one.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Hard suitcases</h2>
        <p>In some very specific circumstances, hard suitcases can offer you two great benefits (but at a cost), which soft suitcases cannot.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Extra lightweight.</strong> Hard shell materials can be extremely (extremely!) lightweight. If you need to pack something very heavy, and you’re really restricted by your airline, this will certainly help. Otherwise, I don’t think 1kg will make a difference to you.</li>
            <li><strong>Better security.</strong> Obviously, hard suitcases offer more protection for fragile items AND are more difficult to cut through by thieves. If you need security for valuable, fragile items, go hard.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>BUT</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Opening them is a hassle.</strong> You need to lay the suitcase flat to open it. And you need to open the whole suitcase. And no, you can’t just open the top and grab that bottle of water you cleverly packed before you left the house.</li>
            <li><strong>Not expandable.</strong> Hard suitcases don’t offer expandable compartments, so there is a lot less flexibility with airline restrictions and your (variable, as we already know) packing needs.</li>
            <li><strong>No external pockets.</strong> On top of that, hard shell suitcases typically don’t have any external pockets for quick access, which can be a hassle.</li>
            <li><strong>Cosmetic damage is visible.</strong> If you (or someone else) accidentally damage the suitcase, it will be a lot more visible than a soft suitcase.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>How hard does your luggage need to be?</h2>
        <p>As you already know, hard suitcases come with a lot of cosmetic and functional problems.</p>
        <p>So think about it carefully for a moment -- what luggage do you really need? What are you going to pack? How much do you value flexibility?</p>
        <p>Either way, if you do your research well, you will most likely end up with a bag that is pretty sturdy. I’m sure you won’t be surprised that most cheap suitcases tear and/or fall apart quickly, but if you go for brands that focus on quality, the suitcase will do really well, no matter whether you go for soft or hard.</p>
        <p>Unless you’re packing something valuable and fragile (and trusting it to baggage-handlers), I would recommend going for a soft suitcase.</p>
