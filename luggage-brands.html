        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>There are many hand luggage brands out there, but there aren't that many that offer a good balance of price and quality. And brand reputation, of course.</p>
        <p>In this review, I am purpusefully limiting the mentions to the top 10 hand luggage brands of 2017. I don't want to overwhelm you with choice, but at the same time I want to cover all price ranges and luggage types - soft, hard, and even smart luggage. For those who are interested, <a href="about.html#how-pick">this is how I researched the brands.</a></p>
        <p>Without any further ado, here's a brief summary of what each branch has to offer.</p>
        
        <h2>The brand list</h2>
        <div class="row">

        <h2 id="Samsonite">Samsonite</h2>
        <p class="rating">Rating: 4.4 / 5<br>High quality</p>
        <p><a href="">Samsonite</a> is perhaps the world's most well known luggage brand. And there is a reason for that -- Samsonite suitcases look great and are very durable and functional, but will not cost you a small fortune.</p> 

        
        <h2 id="AmericanTourister">American Tourister</h2>
        <p class="rating">Rating: 4.6 / 5<br>Well made</p>
        <p><a href="">American Tourister</a> is another great brand, which is in fact owned by <a href="">Samsonite</a>. The biggest difference to me is the incredibly vibrant colours of the suitcases -- a pure joy to look at them. Ah, and they are also cheaper!</p> 
       
        
        <h2 id="BriggsAndRiley">Briggs and Riley</h2>
        <p class="rating">Rating: 4.8 / 5<br>Top quality</p>
        <p>If you are prepared to pay top dollar, <a href="">Briggs and Riley</a> might be the best brand for you -- insane durability, great designs, and a lifetime warranty, which can only speak for the extremely high quality of the suitcases.</p> 
        
        <h2 id="Travelpro">Travelpro</h2>
        <p class="rating">Rating: 4.7 / 5<br>Frequent flyers</p>
        <p>In 1987, the founder of <a href="">Travelpro</a> designed the carry-on suitcase as you know it today. Today, Travelpro suitcases are the choice of many flight attendants -- if you are a frequent flyer, you probably won’t go wrong.</p> 
        
        <h2 id="Bluesmart">Bluesmart</h2>
        <p class="rating">Rating: 4.5 / 5<br>Connected</p>
        <p>If you’re into connected devices, <a href="">Bluesmart</a> suitcases will most likely meet all of your needs -- suitcases that charge your phone, can (almost) never get lost, and weigh themselves. Geeky, but super handy.</p> 
        
        <h2 id="Delsey">Delsey</h2>
        <p class="rating">Rating: 4.6 / 5<br>Beautiful designs</p>
        <p>If I have to think of one brand that offers beautiful designs at a reasonable price, surely that is <a href="">Delsey</a>. Its unmistakably French designs are elegant, unconventional, and instantly recognisable. Those of you who want to keep up with their image while travelling, buy a Delsey suitcase and look no further.</p> 

        <h2 id="Aerolite">Aerolite</h2>
        <p class="rating">Rating: 4.2 / 5<br>Cheap</p>
        <p>Very lightweight and cheap, <a href="">Aerolite</a> suitcase are great for most travellers. Whilst there are some quality issues, none of these are deal breakers, so if you’re looking for a suitcase that won’t break your bank and do a decent job, this is it.</p> 
        
        <h2 id="Antler">Antler</h2>
        <p class="rating">Rating: 4.2 / 5<br>British</p>
        <p>A UK luggage brand with a worldwide reputation, <a href="">Antler</a> has been in business for over 100 years -- go for this if you’d like to get proven quality and support a British brand.</p> 
        
        <h2 id="Tumi">Tumi</h2>
        <p class="rating">Rating: 4.7 / 5<br>Functional superiority</p>
        <p><a href="">Tumi</a> suitcases are designed to make your life and travels easier -- passing through security, carrying multiple bags with one hand, preventing shoulder straps slipping, and lots more. These suitcases are functionally superior but are also priced accordingly. Well worth.</p> 
        
        <h2 id="Victorinox">Victorinox</h2>
        <p class="rating">Rating: 4.1 / 5<br>Swiss quality</p>
        <p>Inspired by the iconic Swiss army knife, <a href="">Victorinox</a> suitcases are packed with functions, both for business and adventure -- start here if you value versatility more than storage space.</p>
