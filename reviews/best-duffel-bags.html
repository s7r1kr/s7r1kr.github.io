									<h3>Our pick: S-ZONE Canvas Leather Travel Duffle</h3>
									<p>Compared with similarly priced duffel bags, our pick better balances comfort, durability, and versatility. This S-ZONE duffel bag is very stylish, strong, durable, and can fit plenty of stuff. We particularly love how well made the bag is and the superb quality of the materials and stitching.</p>

									<h3>Budget pick: 5 Cities Lightweight Duffel Holdall</h3>
									<p>If you want something to get your gym clothes from point A to point B for the least amount of money and you don't need a high quality product, the 5 Cities duffel bag might suit your needs. It can fit all of your stuff and offers better organisation than most duffel bags in this price range. However, its low price is evident in the lower quality materials and uninspiring look.</p>

									<h2>What makes a great duffel bag</h2>
									<p>For travel, business or leisure, the single most important thing is that your duffel bag must fit all of your belongings. For most people we would recommend a bag with a size of at least 30 litres, which is more than enough to fit all of your gym stuff or a everything you need for a weekend getaway. But what makes a great duffel bag? To answer this question, we went through hundreds of products reviews and the analysis revealed that the following features separate a good suitcase from a great one:</p>
									<ul>
									<li>Durable stitching is extremely important, particularly if you're planning to use the duffel bag on a daily basis.</li>
									<li>If you're going to use the duffel to go to the gym or as a carry-on for a flight, make sure it will fit the gym locker or cabin.</li>
									<li>Clever external and internal compartments can be very handy to organise all of your stuff and provide you with easy access to your keys, travel card, etc.</li>
									<li>Shoulder straps with well made padding can make a real difference, especially if you carry heavy stuff.</li>
									<li>Water resistant materials can come in quite handy for rainy days.</li>
									</ul>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Things to watch out for</h2>
									<p>The analysis also revealed the things to watch out for when selecting your new duffel bag. Whilst none of these are deal-breakers, they are all things that can easily be avoided by carefully selecting your bag.</p>
									<ul>
									<li>Not all duffels have adjustable straps or comfortable shoulder padding.</li>
									<li>Avoid duffel bags which look stylish but have poor stitching as they are likely to last less than a month.</li>
									<li>Watch out for the size of the bag as it varies significantly between different models and brands.</li>
									<li>Hard-shell suitcases typically lack external pockets and have less packing space.</li>
									</ul>
						

									<hr class="major" />


									<h2>How we picked the bags</h2>
									<p>There are hundreds of duffel bag options on Amazon, even after filtering for the basic criteria that we use. We compiled a database of 1,000+ verified customer reviews of carry-on suitcases, which we then analysed to narrow down the list. The analysis revealed what features people personally find to be vital, as well as what attributes separate a great duffel bag from an average one. It also allowed us to better understand the differences in size, fabric materials, interior designs, and handle models. Based on this, and coupled with our own extensive research of editorial reviews, we settled on our top picks.</p>
