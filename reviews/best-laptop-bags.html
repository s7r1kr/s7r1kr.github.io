									<h2>What makes a great laptop bag</h2>
									<p>The single most important thing is that your laptop must fit into the bag. Watch out for the bag size, particularly if you have a 17'' laptop. But what makes a truly great laptop bag? To answer this question, we went through hundreds of products reviews and the analysis revealed that the following features separate a good suitcase from a great one:</p>
									<ul>
									<li>Lightweight is not merely a nice to have feature but an essential attribute, as you are most likely already carrying a lot of weight on your shoulders.</li>
									<li>In the same vein, bags that distribute the weight over your shoulders and back well can make a real difference.</li>
									<li>Padding on the inside is very important as it protects your laptop from getting damaged.</li>
									<li>Smart compartments and lots of internal and external pockets can help you organize your stuff.</li>
									<li>High quality materials means that the bag will last for much longer.</li>
									<li>Waterproofing is also really nice to have as it protects your laptop and your work from the rain.</li>
									</ul>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Things to watch out for</h2>
									<p>The analysis also revealed the things to watch out for when selecting your new laptop bag. Whilst none of these are deal-breakers, they are all things that can easily be avoided by carefully selecting your suitcase:</p>
									<ul>
									<li>Some bags don't have enough padding on the shoulder straps, which can make your bag feel a lot heavier than it is.</li>
									<li>Lack of adequate interior padding, particularly on bottom and front of a laptop bag, may mean that your laptop can get damaged more easily.</li>
									<li>We also found some bags without adjustable straps, which can potentially make the bag very uncomfortable for some people.</li>
									</ul>
						

									<hr class="major" />


									<h2>How we selected our top picks</h2>
									<p>There are hundreds of laptop bags on Amazon, even after filtering for the basic criteria that we use. We compiled a database of 1,000+ verified customer reviews of laptop bags, which we then analysed to narrow down the list. The analysis revealed what features people personally find to be vital, as well as what attributes separate a great suitcase from an average one. It also allowed us to better understand the differences in shoulder straps, interior protection, weight distribution, and compartment designs. Based on this, and coupled with our own extensive research of editorial reviews, we settled on our top picks.</p>
