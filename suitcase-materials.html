        <h2 id="soft-side-materials">The best soft-side suitcase materials</h2>
        <p>As you probably already know, I am a supporter of soft-side suitcases for most occasions, so let’s start here:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Nylon.</strong> Quite popular for its lightweight property and extreme strength, nylon is used in top quality soft suitcases. If you really care about your new suitcase, definitely buy a nylon suitcase. To get even more geeky, ballistic nylon is the highest quality option.</li>
            <li><strong>Polyester.</strong> This is an artificial (man-made) material that can have a very nice look, matte or shiny, but it has a slightly inferior quality to nylon. Having said that, polyester suitcases can be great value for money, so if you’re after a bargain, search for polyester suitcases.</li>
            <li><strong>PVC.</strong> Very flexible and waterproof, but not strong enough, so it must be used in combination with other materials. Don’t buy suitcases made PVC only, however cheap they are.</li>
        </ul>

        
        <h2 id="hard-side-materials">The best hard-side suitcase materials</h2>
        <p>If you need to protect fragile and valuable items, then you should consider one the following hard-side suitcase materials:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Polycarbonate. </strong> This is the highest quality option, often used in high-end suitcase ranges from most brands. It’s very good as it is extremely strong and lightweight, but can also bend and flex back to its original shape to absorb even more impact. It’s impossible to break, apparently. If you’re after the best, buy a polycarbonate suitcase.</li>
            <li><strong>Polypropylene.</strong> Well, car bumpers are made from this, so it’s pretty sturdy. These suitcases can be slightly heavier, but will give you confidence your items won’t break.</li>
            <li><strong>ABS plastic.</strong> One of the many uses of ABS plastic is for crash helmets, so again, it is a strong material, but not quite as strong as the other options. It is often used in combination with other materials, because of its low price and light weight. Avoid ABS-only suitcases.</li>
            <li><strong>Aluminum.</strong> This is one of the strongest and most beautiful options, without a doubt. It is also the most expensive one, so unless you’re after a premium product (aluminum suitcases simply look incredible), you will be better off going for a polycarbonate suitcase.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="which-material-to-pick">Which material you should pick</h2>
        <p>I will narrow down the material options to just four and will also recommend you a suitcase for each option -- I am sure you will pick best one for you easily.</p>
