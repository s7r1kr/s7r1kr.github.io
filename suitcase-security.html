        <h2 id=”types-thieves”>Types of thieves</h2>

<p>It is shocking to see how easy it is for thieves to open most suitcases and then reseal them, without any signs of tampering. But there are two types of thieves, quite different from each other.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Opportunistic thieves</strong> randomly open bags and go through old clothes and (potentially used) underwear, hoping to find something of value. As you can probably imagine, there aren’t very many opportunistic thieves out there. Most of them are actually pros, who do this for a living (or at least a juicy part-time job).</li>

<li><strong>The pros</strong> look at the luggage scanners, target suitcases, and follow them accordingly - a lot more intelligent than what most people are giving them credit for. And if they can’t open the bag because of a clever lock, guess what -- they take the whole suitcase.</li>
</ul>
<p>While on the topic of taking the whole suitcase, it’s important to note that even opportunistic thieves can do that, if you leave your bag unattended, or maybe even at your hotel or (more likely) hostel room.</p>

<h2 id=”when-suitcase-at-risk”>When is your suitcase at risk?</h2>

<p>There are two main scenarios to think about with regard to suitcase security and when it is exposed to risk:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>On a plane and/or the airport.</strong> As you know, don’t leave your luggage unattended at the airport. Apart from that, when you hand over your checked luggage to the airport staff, it’s outside of your control. There’s also a small chance your carry-on might get robbed on board, but it’s tiny -- I wouldn’t worry about it.</li>
<li><strong>Your hotel room or a cosy coffee shop.</strong> You will almost without a doubt leave your suitcase in your hotel or hostel room, which puts it at risk. Or you will be enjoying a nice coffee or an ice cold beer with your suitcase by your table, which puts it at risk.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s dive into how you can make it harder for anyone to mess with your suitcase, anywhere.</p>

<h2 id=”pack-security”>How to pack for increased security</h2>

<p>The best advice I can give you is to not put anything that you can’t afford to lose in your checked luggage.</p>

<p>But, let’s be real for a moment -- this is an impractical advice, and I know it. You will most likely end up putting things inside the checked luggage that you can afford to lose, but it would be extremely annoying to replace them -- cameras, cables, chargers, kindles, international adapters, etc.</p>

<p>The best you can do is follow a simple staircase rule. To do this, you will need at least 2 bags (3 bags if you have lots of luggage) -- a shoulder bag that is always on you, carry-on luggage that you expect to board on the plane, and an optional checked suitcase.</p>

<p>So, here is how to pack for increased security:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Put your most valuable items in your smallest bag.</strong> Cash, an expensive necklace, important documents -- all of these must go in a bag that you don’t leave anywhere or trust to someone else. You are ultimately responsible for the safety of this bag.</li>
<li><strong>Put anything that you need to do your work or fully enjoy your holiday in your carry-on luggage.</strong> For example, a bulky camera, laptop, hard drive, books, documents, among others. It’s important to remember that airlines and airports don’t always take great care of your checked luggage.</li>
<li><strong>Remember that you can be asked to check-in your carry-on luggage.</strong> As annoying as this is, it has happened to me multiple times. At least I enjoy the heated arguments with the unlucky airport staff. Here is what to do: have a smaller tote bag in your carry-on, which you can use to take some items on board. Clever, I know.</li>
    <li><strong>Everything else goes in your checked luggage.</strong> Not much else to say here apart from that if you still have valuables, which are also fragile, you should get a <a href="hard-or-soft-suitcase.html">hard-side suitcase.</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id=”secure-suitcase”>How to secure your suitcase</h2>

<p>Apart from that, make your bag a little more difficult to open. The longer the time to open the bag, the more secure the bag. You see, windows of opportunity for a theft are typically quite small. So, a thief is more likely to go for a bag that is easy to open.</p>

<p>Here are the various options to secure your suitcase:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Padlock and cable.</strong> These are probably the most useful and practical items on the list. You can lock and tie your suitcase to a fixed object while staying in hostels, sleeper trains, or enjoying a beer with a friend you haven’t seen in while. What makes them useful is that it makes it a lot harder for thieves to steal your whole suitcase. The rest of the items on the list don’t do that.</li>
<li><strong>Suitcase fixed locks.</strong> A fixed lock is a feature of a suitcase that allows you to keep the zippers in a fixed position. You might seen videos in which suitcases are opened with just a ballpoint pen. Whilst you can’t prevent this with a fixed lock, you can make it impossible for thieves to reseal the zippers. If your suitcase has a fixed lock to keep the zippers in place, use it.</li>
<li><strong>TSA security lock.</strong> These locks are recognised by the Travel Security Administration (TSA), which means that you can lock your bags and still allow for TSA inspections without damage to the lock or your luggage. A lot of suitcases come with this type of lock as a standard.</li>
<li><strong>Tamper lock.</strong> If your suitcase does not have a fixed lock feature, you could use a tamper lock. It is just another way to identify that someone has tampered with your suitcase using the ballpoint pen trick, but it can’t really prevent it, and it’s not as reliable as other methods. Basically, the tamper lock is a piece of paper attached to the handle and the zippers, preventing the zippers from moving all the way without damaging the paper.</li>
<li><strong>Plastic wrap.</strong>You’ve probably noticed that some people wrap their luggage in clingfilm. It can serve three purposes: firstly, it protect your suitcase from liquid damage; secondly, it means an opportunistic thief needs to spend more time to open your suitcase, so it won’t be as attractive; thirdly, it protects nice suitcases from dents and scratches. Some people think it’s worth it, others don’t - it depends on the content and price of your suitcase.</li>
<li><strong>Cable ties.</strong> These don’t really prevent theft, but can let you know if your bag has been tampered with. Cable ties are simple plastic ties that go into the zippers instead of a padlock. I recommend numbered cable ties -- this way, the cable tie cannot be replaced with an identical one. And take a photo of the number, so that you don’t forget it. This way, you will also have proof to show to airline staff and the police.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bottom line is that if you want to take some extra steps to secure your suitcase, you need to buy a lock with a cable, so that you can tie your case to a fixed object -- this will give you some peace of mind when you leave your suitcase unattended, in your hotel room for example.</p>

<p>Other than that, pick one of the other options to make sure you can at least prove that someone has tampered with your suitcase and make your conversation with security and the police a little easier.</p>
