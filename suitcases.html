        <h2>What makes a great suitcase</h2>
        <p>The single most important thing is that your suitcase must fit your airline's hand luggage dimensions or you may need to check it in and pay extra.</p> 
        
        <p>But what makes a great suitcase?</p> 
        
        <p>To answer this question, I went through hundreds of products reviews and my analysis revealed that the following features separate a good suitcase from a great one:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="hard-or-soft-suitcase.html">Soft suitcases are a lot more flexible</a> than hard suitcases.</li>
            <li>Lightweight is not merely a nice to have feature but an essential attribute due to airline hand luggage weight limitations.</li>
            <li>Numerical combination locks can provide extra security and peace of mind for your valuables.</li>
            <li><a href="2-wheels-4-wheels.html">Suitcases with 4-wheels</a> are easier to roll in any direction.</li>
            <li>If you are a frequent flyer, durability is the single most important feature to look for.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Things to watch out for</h2>
        <p>My analysis also revealed the things to watch out for when selecting your hand luggage. Whilst none of these are deal-breakers, they are all things that can easily be avoided by carefully selecting your suitcase.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Some very lightweight suitcases cannot stand upright, unless leaned against a wall.</li>
            <li>Lower quality suitcases are more likely to get cosmetic damage, or even get their fabric ripped.</li>
            <li>Spinner versions of suitcases (4-wheels) may have less internal space than two-wheeled equivalents.</li>
            <li><a href="hard-or-soft-suitcase.html">Hard-shell suitcases</a> typically lack external pockets, it's more difficult to open them, and cosmetic damage is visible.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>The best suitcase brands</h2>
        
        <p>If you are struggling to pick a suitcase brand, you're not alone. There are too many brands that appear to be similar and yet they are slightly different. Different enough to make the decision a difficult one.</p>   
        <p>Don't base your decision just on price. I'm not saying go for expensive suitcases. I am saying consider the quality and the reputation of brand, both of which are evident in customer reviews.</p>
        <p>I have compiled an <a href="luggage-brands.html">overview of the best suitcase brands</a>, based on expert reviews, as well as real, paying customer reviews. The only evidence of the quality of a brand that I consider to be true is what customer say. And so should you.</p>
